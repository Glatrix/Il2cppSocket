# Current State
TO-DO is add more here.

Planning to use NO WPM/RPM functionality. All interactions with said target process should be done
through the C++ backend dll.

Socket DLL has to be Manually Injected. Plans to make the C# (front end) evenutally inject on its own
with a function that has a processname paramater, and maybe a port paramater (for picking what port to host on).
